# simple-onboarding
Originally created during an internship to simplify an onboarding process to activate payments, this library features a client for the Google Drive and Google Docs APIs for OCR as well as a client for the Dun & Bradstreet API. On top of those there's an API that you can host to interface your own App or Website with these APIs using different routes.
All this is designed to make the process of getting information on a company much easier.
